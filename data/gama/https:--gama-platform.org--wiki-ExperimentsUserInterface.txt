Experiments User InterfaceAs soon as an experiment is launched, the modeler is facing a new environment (with different menus and views) called the Simulation Perspective). The Navigator is still available in this perspective (below the parameter view), though, and it is still possible to edit models in it, but it is considered as good practice to use each perspective for what it has been designed for: editing models in the Modeling perspective and running simulations in the Simulation perspective. Switching perspectives is easy. The small button in the top-left corner of the window allows to switch back and forth the two perspectives.

The actual contents of the simulation perspective will depend on the experiment being run and the outputs it defines. The next sections will present the most common ones (inspectors, monitors and displays), as well as the views that are not defined in outputs, like the Parameters or Errors view. An overview of the menus and commands specific to the simulation perspective is also available.
