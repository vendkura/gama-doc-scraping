File TypesGAMA provides modelers with a generic type for files called file. It is possible to load a file using the file operator:
file my_file <- file("../includes/data.csv");
However, internally, GAMA makes the difference between the different types of files.
Indeed, for instance:
global {	init {		file my_file <- file("../includes/data.csv");		loop el over: my_file {			write el;		}	}}
will give:
sepallengthsepalwidthpetallengthpetalwidthtype5.13.51.40.2Iris-setosa4.93.01.40.2Iris-setosa...
Indeed, the content of CSV file is a matrix: each row of the matrix is a line of the file; each column of the matrix is value delimited by the separator (by default ",").
In contrary:
global {	init {		file my_file <- file("../includes/data.shp");		loop el over: my_file {			write el;		}	}}
will give:
PolygonPolygonPolygonPolygonPolygonPolygonPolygon
The content of a shapefile is a list of geometries corresponding to the objects of the shapefile.
In order to know how to load a file, GAMA analyzes its extension. For instance for a file with a ".csv" extension, GAMA knows that the file is a csv one and will try to split each line with the , separator. However, if the modeler wants to split each line with a different separator (for instance ;) or load it as a text file, he/she will have to use a specific file operator.
Indeed, GAMA integrates specific operators corresponding to different types of files.

Text File​
Extensions​
Here the list of possible extensions for text file:

"txt"
"data"
"csv"
"text"
"tsv"
"xml"

Note that when trying to define the type of a file with the default file loading operator (file), GAMA will first try to test the other type of file. For example, for files with ".csv" extension, GAMA will cast them as csv file and not as text file.
Content​
The content of a text file is a list of string corresponding to each line of the text file.
For example:
global {	init {		file my_file <- text_file("../includes/data.txt");		loop el over: my_file {			write el;		}	}}
will give:
sepallength,sepalwidth,petallength,petalwidth,type5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa4.9,3.0,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa4.7,3.2,1.3,0.2,Iris-setosa
Operators​
List of operators related to text files:

text_file(string path): load a file (with an authorized extension) as a text file.
text_file(string path, list content): load a file (with an authorized extension) as a text file and fill it with the given content.
is_text(op): tests whether the operand is a text file

CSV File​
Extensions​
Here the list of possible extensions for csv file:

"csv"
"tsv"

Content​
The content of a csv file is a matrix of objects: each row of the matrix is a line of the file; each column of the matrix is values delimited by the separator. By default, the delimiter is the "," and the datatype depends on the dataset.
For example:
global {	init {		file my_file <- csv_file("../includes/data.csv");		loop el over: my_file {			write el;		}	}}
will give:
sepallengthsepalwidthpetallengthpetalwidthtype5.13.51.40.2Iris-setosa4.93.01.40.2Iris-setosa...
To manipulate easily the data, we can consider the contents of the data file, that is a matrix.
As  an example, we can access the number of lines and columns of a data file named my_file with my_file.contents.dimension.
Operators​
There are many operators available to load a csv_file.

csv_file(string path): load a file (with an authorized extension) as a csv file with default separator (","), and no assumption on the type of data.
csv_file(string path,bool header)": load a file as a CSV file with the default separator (coma), with specifying if the model has a header or not (boolean), and no assumption on the type of data.
csv_file(string path, string separator): load a file (with an authorized extension) as a csv file with the given separator, without making any assumption on the type of data. Headers should be detected automatically if they exist.

file my_file <- csv_file("../includes/data.csv", ";");

csv_file(string path, string separator, bool header): load a file (with an authorized extension) as a csv file, specifying (1) the separator used; (2) if the model has a header or not, without making any assumption on the type of data.
csv_file(string path, string separator, string text_qualifier, bool header): load a file as a csv file	specifying (1) the separator used; (2) the text qualifier used; (3) if the model has a header or not, without making any assumption on the type of data",
csv_file(string path, string separator, type datatype): load a file as a csv file specifying a given separator, no header, and the type of data. No text qualifier will be used.

file my_file <- csv_file("../includes/data.csv", ";", int);

csv_file(string path, string separator, string text_qualifier, type datatype): load a file as a csv file specifying the separator, text qualifier to use, and the type of data to read.  Headers should be detected automatically if they exist.
csv_file(string path, string separator, type datatype, bool header): load a file as a csv file specifying the given separator, the type of data, with specifying if the model has a header or not (boolean). No text qualifier will be used".
csv_file(string path, string separator, type datatype, bool header, point dimensions): load a file as a csv file specifying a given separator, the type of data, with specifying the number of cols and rows taken into account. No text qualifier will be used.
csv_file(string path, matrix content): This file constructor allows to store a matrix in a CSV file (it does not save it - just store it in memory)

Finally, it is possible to check whether a file is a csv file:

is_csv(op): tests whether the operand is a csv file

Shapefile​
Shapefiles are classical GIS data files. A shapefile is not simple file, but a set of several files (source: wikipedia):

Mandatory files :

.shp - shape format; the feature geometry itself
.shx - shape index format; a positional index of the feature geometry to allow seeking forwards and backwards quickly
.dbf - attribute format; columnar attributes for each shape, in dBase IV format


Optional files :

.prj - projection format; the coordinate system and projection information, a plain text file describing the projection using well-known text format
.sbn and .sbx - a spatial index of the features
.fbn and .fbx - a spatial index of the features for shapefiles that are read-only
.ain and .aih - an attribute index of the active fields in a table
.ixs - a geocoding index for read-write shapefiles
.mxs - a geocoding index for read-write shapefiles (ODB format)
.atx - an attribute index for the .dbf file in the form of shapefile.columnname.atx (ArcGIS 8 and later)
.shp.xml - geospatial metadata in XML format, such as ISO 19115 or other XML schema
.cpg - used to specify the code page (only for .dbf) for identifying the character encoding to be used



More details about shapefiles can be found here.
Extensions​

Content​
The content of a shapefile is a list of geometries corresponding to the objects of the shapefile.

Note that the attributes of each object of the shapefile are stored in their corresponding GAMA geometry. The operator "get" (or "read") allows to get the value of corresponding attributes.
For example:
file my_file <- shape_file("../includes/data.shp");write "my_file: " + my_file.contents;loop el over: my_file {	write (el get "TYPE");}

OSM File​
OSM (Open Street Map) is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. The data produced in this project (OSM File)  represent physical features on the ground (e.g., roads or buildings) using tags attached to its basic data structures (its nodes, ways, and relations). Each tag describes a geographic attribute of the feature being shown by that specific node, way or relation (source: openstreetmap.org).
