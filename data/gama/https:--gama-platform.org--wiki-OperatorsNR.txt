Definition​
Operators in the GAML language are used to compose complex expressions. An operator performs a function on one, two, or n operands (which are other expressions and thus may be themselves composed of operators) and returns the result of this function.
Most of them use a classical prefixed functional syntax (i.e. operator_name(operand1, operand2, operand3), see below), with the exception of arithmetic (e.g. +, /), logical (and, or), comparison (e.g. >, <), access (., [..]) and pair (::) operators, which require an infixed notation (i.e. operand1 operator_symbol operand1).
The ternary functional if-else operator, ? :, uses a special infixed syntax composed with two symbols (e.g. operand1 ? operand2 : operand3). Two unary operators (- and !) use a traditional prefixed syntax that does not require parentheses unless the operand is itself a complex expression (e.g.  - 10, ! (operand1 or operand2)).
Finally, special constructor operators ({...} for constructing points, [...] for constructing lists and maps) will require their operands to be placed between their two symbols (e.g. {1,2,3}, [operand1, operand2, ..., operandn] or [key1::value1, key2::value2... keyn::valuen]).
With the exception of these special cases above, the following rules apply to the syntax of operators:

if they only have one operand, the functional prefixed syntax is mandatory (e.g. operator_name(operand1))
if they have two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax (e.g. operator_name(operand1, operand2)) or the infixed syntax (e.g. operand1 operator_name operand2) can be used.
if they have more than two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax (e.g. operator_name(operand1, operand2, ..., operand)) or a special infixed syntax with the first operand on the left-hand side of the operator name (e.g. operand1 operator_name(operand2, ..., operand)) can be used.

All of these alternative syntaxes are completely equivalent.
Operators in GAML are purely functional, i.e. they are guaranteed to not have any side effects on their operands. For instance, the shuffle operator, which randomizes the positions of elements in a list, does not modify its list operand but returns a new shuffled list.

Priority between operators​
The priority of operators determines, in the case of complex expressions composed of several operators, which one(s) will be evaluated first.
GAML follows in general the traditional priorities attributed to arithmetic, boolean, comparison operators, with some twists. Namely:

the constructor operators, like ::, used to compose pairs of operands, have the lowest priority of all operators (e.g. a > b :: b > c will return a pair of boolean values, which means that the two comparisons are evaluated before the operator applies. Similarly, [a > 10, b > 5] will return a list of boolean values.
it is followed by the ?: operator, the functional if-else (e.g.  a > b ? a + 10 : a - 10 will return the result of the if-else).
next are the logical operators, and and or (e.g. a > b or b > c will return the value of the test)
next are the comparison operators (i.e. >, <, <=, >=, =, !=)
next the arithmetic operators in their logical order (multiplicative operators have a higher priority than additive operators)
next the unary operators - and !
next the access operators . and [] (e.g. {1,2,3}.x > 20 + {4,5,6}.y will return the result of the comparison between the x and y ordinates of the two points)
and finally the functional operators, which have the highest priority of all.


Using actions as operators​
Actions defined in species can be used as operators, provided they are called on the correct agent. The syntax is that of normal functional operators, but the agent that will perform the action must be added as the first operand.
For instance, if the following species is defined:
species spec1 {        int min(int x, int y) {                return x > y ? x : y;        }}
Any agent instance of spec1 can use min as an operator (if the action conflicts with an existing operator, a warning will be emitted). For instance, in the same model, the following line is perfectly acceptable:
global {        init {                create spec1;                spec1 my_agent <- spec1[0];                int the_min <- my_agent min(10,20); // or min(my_agent, 10, 20);        }}
If the action doesn't have any operands, the syntax to use is my_agent the_action(). Finally, if it does not return a value, it might still be used but is considering as returning a value of type unknown (e.g. unknown result <- my_agent the_action(op1, op2);).
Note that due to the fact that actions are written by modelers, the general functional contract is not respected in that case: actions might perfectly have side effects on their operands (including the agent).

Operators​

nb_cycles​
Possible uses:​

nb_cycles (graph) --->  int

Result:​
returns the maximum number of independent cycles in a graph. This number (u) is estimated through the number of nodes (v), links (e) and of sub-graphs (p): u = e - v + p.
Examples:​
graph graphEpidemio <- graph([]); int var1 <- nb_cycles(graphEpidemio); // var1 equals the number of cycles in the graph
See also: alpha_index, beta_index, gamma_index, connectivity_index,

neighbors_at​
Possible uses:​

geometry neighbors_at float --->  list
neighbors_at (geometry , float) --->  list

Result:​
a list, containing all the agents of the same species than the left argument (if it is an agent) located at a distance inferior or equal to the right-hand operand to the left-hand operand (geometry, agent, point).
Comment:​
The topology used to compute the neighborhood  is the one of the left-operand if this one is an agent; otherwise the one of the agent applying the operator.
Examples:​
list var0 <- (self neighbors_at (10)); // var0 equals all the agents located at a distance lower or equal to 10 to the agent applying the operator.

neighbors_of (graph , unknown) --->  list
topology neighbors_of agent --->  list
neighbors_of (topology , agent) --->  list
neighbors_of (topology, geometry, float) --->  list

Result:​
a list, containing all the agents of the same species than the argument (if it is an agent) located at a distance inferior or equal to 1 to the right-hand operand agent considering the left-hand operand topology.
Special cases:​

a list, containing all the agents of the same species than the left argument (if it is an agent) located at a distance inferior or equal to the third argument to the second argument (agent, geometry or point) considering the first operand topology.

list var0 <- neighbors_of (topology(self), self,10); // var0 equals all the agents located at a distance lower or equal to 10 to the agent applying the operator considering its topology.
Examples:​
list var1 <- graphEpidemio neighbors_of (node(3)); // var1 equals [node0,node2] list var2 <- graphFromMap neighbors_of node({12,45}); // var2 equals [{1.0,5.0},{34.0,56.0}] list var3 <- topology(self) neighbors_of self; // var3 equals returns all the agents located at a distance lower or equal to 1 to the agent applying the operator considering its topology.

container of_species species --->  list
of_species (container , species) --->  list

Result:​
a list, containing the agents of the left-hand operand whose species is the one denoted by the right-hand operand.The expression agents of_species (species self) is equivalent to agents where (species each = species self); however, the advantage of using the first syntax is that the resulting list is correctly typed with the right species, whereas, in the second syntax, the parser cannot determine the species of the agents within the list (resulting in the need to cast it explicitly if it is to be used in an ask statement, for instance).

The index of the best candidate according to the Promethee II method. This method is based on a comparison per pair of possible candidates along each criterion: all candidates are compared to each other by pair and ranked. More information about this method can be found in Behzadian, M., Kazemzadeh, R., Albadvi, A., M., A.: PROMETHEE: A comprehensive literature review on methodologies and applications. European Journal of Operational Research(2010).

The preference value represents the threshold from which the difference between two criterion values allows to prefer one vector of values over another. The indifference value represents the threshold from which the difference between two criterion values is considered significant.
Special cases:​
