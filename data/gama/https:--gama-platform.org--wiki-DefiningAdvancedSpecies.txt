Defining advanced speciesIn the previous chapter, we saw how to declare and manipulate regular species and the global species (as a reminder, the instance of the global species is the world agent).
We will now see that GAMA provides you the possibility to declare some special species, such as grids or graphs, with their own built-in attributes and their own built-in actions. We will also see how to declare mirror species, which is a "copy" of a regular species, in order to give it an other representation. Finally, we will learn how to represent several agents through one unique agent, with multi-level architecture.
