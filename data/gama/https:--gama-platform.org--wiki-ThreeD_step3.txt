Mapping the network of connection


Model Definition​
In this final step, we will display edges between cells that are within a given distance.
Cells update​
We add a new reflex to collect the neighbors of the cell that are within a certain distance:
species cells skills:[moving3D]{...    reflex compute_neighbors {        neighbors <- cells select ((each distance_to self) < 10);    }  	}
Then we update the cell aspect as follows. For each element (cells) of the neighbors list, we draw a line between this neighbor's location and the current cell's location.
aspect default {    draw sphere(environment_size*0.01) color: #orange;    loop pp over: neighbors {        draw line([self.location,pp.location]);    }	}
